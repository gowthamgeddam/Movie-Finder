# Movie-Finder
A search engine for movies
- that I made during summer vacation (Summer 2022), while learning Basics of Web Development.
- it uses [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to get details for movies.

## Working
* To see it working, download the repo or [clone it](#clone). <br>
  _I tried to make it available through github pages, but github pages only support static webpages_
* Inside templates folder ðŸ“‚, open [html][HTMLfile] file in your browser and it will work.
* If you face any difficulties or want to share feedback, [mailme][Mail].
* For quick fixes, search on [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) or [google](https://www.google.com/).
